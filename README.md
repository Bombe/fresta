# fresta: a Freenet REST API

The Freenet REST API is an attempt to let clients access Freenet using a simple API for which more clients are available. It is also hoped that client application can use this API to access a Freenet node on a remote node, using an SSL-secured and authenticated reverse proxy between the client and the node, e.g. on mobile phones.
